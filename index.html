At last, the country had come up with its own funding.There was not only an economic issue but also an environmental problem. The river Padma has two natures calm in winter and cruel in summer. So, the construction process was divided into 6 parts.The first was constructing the main bridge. The second part was River training works around 14 km (1.6 Mawa + 12.4 in Janjira). The third and fourth parts were connecting the main bridge with two highways. The final part was constructing the service area and supervision.The bridge will connect the southwest part of the country with the capital and eastern part.
